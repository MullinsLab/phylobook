This folder contains a sample data set of SARS-CoV2 DNA sequences from the spike protein region of the genome of sequences obtained in the state of Washington 
between the months of March 2020 and July 2022.  SARS-CoV2 sequences were obtained from the NCBI SARS-CoV-2 Data Hub at 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Nucleotide&VirusLineage_ss=SARS-CoV-2,%20taxid:2697049.
Sequences were filtered to obtain full length viral genomes from the state of Washington over the time between 3/1/2020 and 7/31/2022.  To sub sample the 
data, 10 sequences were selected from the list for each month.  E.g. the first 10 sequences in the months of 3/2020, 4/2020...7/2022 were sub-selected from the 
downloaded data.  This results in a data set that is small enough to visually display in phylobook and which reasonably samples SARS-CoV2 sequences within
the state of Washinton across this time frame.  All sequences were mapped to the original WuHan reference sequence and the spike region was extracted. For each
sequence, the name was modified to include the month from which it was extracted - e.g. sequence_name_yyyy_mm. The data were further processed using the data 
processing pipline found at https://github.com/MullinsLab/phylobook/tree/master/dataprocessing_software.  Processing collapses identical sequences into one sequence
for display in Phylobook.  In order to retain some data information on the collapsed sequences, after processing, the names of the collapsed sequeces
were manually edited to end in the median date of the collapsed sequences.
